ðŸš€ Just Completed a New Project! ðŸš€

I recently built a sleek and responsive Profile Card using only HTML and CSS. ðŸŽ¨

This project was a great way to refine my front-end skills and focus on clean, efficient design principles. The card features a modern layout, subtle animations, and is fully responsive across all devices. It was a fun challenge to bring the design to life while ensuring that it remains functional and visually appealing on any screen size.

Check out the details and let me know what you think! I'm always open to feedback and eager to connect with fellow developers.
