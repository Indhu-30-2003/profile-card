Profile card:

I recently built a sleek and responsive Profile Card using only HTML and CSS. ðŸŽ¨

This project was a great way to refine my front-end skills and focus on clean, efficient design principles. The card features a modern layout, subtle animations, and is fully responsive across all devices. It was a fun challenge to bring the design to life while ensuring that it remains functional and visually appealing on any screen size.
